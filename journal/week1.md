- Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script

- Uses multi-stage building to build images.

- Ensured the apps were running locally without any issues.

- Created the Notification Section on the Cruddur Application.

- Tagged and Pushed images created  to DockerHub.

- Implemented healthcheck in the Docker compose file.

- Researched and implemented best practices of Dockerfiles in my Dockerfile

- Installed Docker on my localmachine and got the same containers running outside of Gitpod.

- Launched an EC2 instance with docker installed, and pulled a container to run my docker processes.
